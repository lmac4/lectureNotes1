Exam 2:
- Thursday, October 10 9:30-10:45
- Closed notes, closed computers
- All "open-ended" problems - similar to HW 4-6

- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic, esp. with:
    ImplyI, NegE, NegI, BottomE, PbC
--> still expected to be familiar with all other rules

Sets, including:
    - set builder notation
    - N (natural, all positive), Z (integers), R (reals)
    - union, intersection, difference, subsets
    - general reasoning about sets

Predicate logic statements, including:
    - quantifiers
    - interpreting predicate logic statements in English
    - translating English statements to predicate logic
    - evaluating predicate logic statements in a domain
    - working with predicate logic statements involving sets
        of numbers
    - DeMorgan's laws
    - negating predicate logic statements

- Natural deduction proofs in predicate logic
    using: AllE, AllI, ExistsI

- Using natural deduction to prove two statements are equivalent


--> how to prepare?
    get out paper
    work through old homework problems
    work through old lecture example

--> homework solutions

Work through practice exam (will post solution after class)
