Evaluating predicate logic statements

1) ∀ x P(x)
    translation: all x's are P-ish
    true when: we can show P(x) is true for EVERY element x in the domain
    false when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is false

2) ∃ x P(x)
    translation: there exists an x that is P-ish
    true when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is true
    false when: we can show that P(x) is false for EVERY element x
                    in the domain

3) ¬(∀ x P(x))
    translation: not all x's are P-ish
    true when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is false
    false when: we can show that P(x) is true for EVERY element x

4) ¬(∃ x P(x))
    translation: there does not exist an x that is P-ish
    true when: we can show that P(x) is false for EVERY element x
    false when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is true

5) ∀ x ¬P(x)
    translation: all x's are not P-ish
    true when: we can show P(x) is false for EVERY element x
    false when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is true

6) ∃ x ¬P(x)
    translation: there is an x that is not P-ish
    true when: we can find ONE individual k where P(k) is false
    false when: we can show P(x) is true for EVERY element x

Domain: steak, ice cream, pineapple, cheese, (vegan) crackers
Predicates: IsSweet(x), IsPlant(x), IsVegan(x), IsMeat(x)


Translate/evaluate:
    ∀ x ¬IsSweet(x)
        All foods are not sweet
        False - ice cream is sweet

    ¬(∀ x (IsVegan(x) → IsPlant(x)))
        Not all vegan foods are plants
        True - crackers are vegan but are not plants

    ¬(∃ x (IsSweet(x) ⋀ IsMeat(x)))
        There is not a meat that is sweet
        true - there is no food that is both meat and also sweet
            (the only meat is steak, and it is not sweet)

    ∃ x ¬(IsSweet(x) ⋀ IsMeat(x))
        There exists a food that isn't both sweet and meat
        True - crackers aren't both sweet and a meat



//////////////////////

Domain: ℤ (the integers)


What do these mean in English? Are they true?


∀ n ∃ m (n^2 < m)
    The square of all integers is less than some other integer
    true - for n^2, n^2 +1 is an integer that is bigger

∀ x ∃ y (x == y^2)

    All integers are a perfect square
    false - 5 is an integer that is not a perfect square



∀ n ∃ m (n^2 == m)
    the square of each integer is another integer
    (true -- integers are closed under multiplication,
        meaning that n*n is also an integer)

∃ m ∀ n (n^2 == m)
    we can find an integer (the SAME integer in all cases)
    that equals the square of all integers

    (false -- there is no one integer that is the square
    of every integer)


/////////////////////////

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

/////////////////////////


Write the following in predicate logic:
----------------------------------------

The sum of two negative integers is negative

Domain: ℤ

∀ x ∀ y (x < 0 ⋀ y < 0 → x + y < 0)
    true - adding two negative numbers can't get bigger




The difference of two positive integers is
not necessarily positive

    x - y

true: 5 - 6

∃ x ∃ y (x > 0 ⋀ y > 0 ⋀ x - y <= 0 )

¬(∀ x ∀ y ( x > 0 ⋀ y > 0 → x - y > 0))


/////////////////////////

Equivalence: DeMorgan's law (part 1).

¬(∃ x P(x))         ∀ x (¬P(x))


suppose our domain is k1 through kn


¬(∃ x P(x)) is  equivalent to...¬(P(k1) V P(k2) V ... V P(Kn))
        ¬P(k1) ⋀ ¬P(k2) ⋀ ... ⋀ ¬P(n)
        ∀ x ¬P(x)







///////////////////////////////////////

Equivalence: DeMorgan's law (part 2).

¬(∀ x P(x))       ∃ x (¬P(x))


suppose our domain is k1 through kn



¬(∀ x P(x)) is equivalent to...
    ¬(P(k1) ^ P(k2) ^ ... ^ P(kn))
     ¬P(k1) V ¬P(k2) V ... V ¬P(kn)


∃ x (¬P(x)) is equivalent to...?


//////////////////////////////////////

Apply DeMorgan's laws: example

Domain: students
Predicates:
    in5th(x): student x is in 5th grade
    wonPrize(x): student x won a prize
    friendsWith(x, y): student x is friends with student y


1) Express the statement in predicate logic

2) Negate the statement so no negation is outside a quantifier
or outside a statement with logical connectives

    Reminder:
        p → q is equivalent to: ¬p ⋁ q
        ¬(p ⋀ q) is equivalent to: ¬p ⋁ ¬q
        ¬(p ⋁ q) is equivalent to: ¬p ⋀ ¬q
        ¬(p → q) is equivalent to: ???

///
Domain: students
    in5th(x): student x is in 5th grade
    wonPrize(x): student x won a prize
    friendsWith(x, y): student x is friends with student y



A 5th grader won a prize


Translation: ∃ x (in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(x))

Negation: ¬(∃ x (in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(x)))
    ∀ x ¬(in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(x))
    ∀ x (¬in5th(x) V ¬wonPrize(x))
    ∀ x (in5th(x) → ¬wonPrize(x))


    All 5th graders didn't win a prize

///

All prize-winners were 5th graders

Translation: ∀ x (wonPrize(x) → in5th(x))

Negation:
    ¬(∀ x (wonPrize(x) → in5th(x)))
    ∃ x ¬(wonPrize(x) → in5th(x))
    ∃ x ¬(¬wonPrize(x) V in5th(x))
    ∃ x (wonPrize(x) ^ ¬in5th(x))

    There is a prize-winner who isn't in 5th grade


///

A 5th grader is friends with all prize winners

Translation:
    ∃ x ∀ y (in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(y) ^ friends(x, y))

Negation:
    ¬(∃ x ∀ y (in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(y) ^ friends(x, y)))
    ∀ x ∃ y ¬((in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(y)) ^ friends(x, y))
    ∀ x ∃ y (¬(in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(y)) V ¬friends(x, y))
    ∀ x ∃ y ((in5th(x) ^ wonPrize(y)) → ¬friends(x, y))

   All 5th graders have a prize winner that they're not friends with

Arguments in predicate logic

Set of premises
Conclusion

Argument is VALID: regardless of domain,
    whenever all the premises are true,
    then the conclusion is also true

Argument is INVALID: we can find a domain where
    all the premises are true but the conclusion is false



Examples -- are the following arguments valid?

///

Premises: ∀ x (P(x) → Q(x)), ∃ x P(x)
Conclusion: ∃ x Q(x)

Valid or not? valid - whichever individual P was true for,
    Q will also be true for that individual


///

Premises: ∀ x P(x) : everyone in my domain is P-ish
Conclusion: ∃ x P(x): there is someone in domain who is P-ish

Valid or not? what if my domain is empty
    not valid because it wouldn't hold in that case


/////////////////////////////////

Proofs in predicate logic.

- want to formalize the kind of reasoning from above

- want valid inference rules that do NOT depend on the domain
    (there is no way to do the equivalent of a
    "truth table proof" in predicate logic...
        there are infinitely many domains!)

- add inference rules on quantifiers to our deduction rules


////////////////////////////////

Writing predicate logic statements in Logika

In Logika, ∀ x P(x) is written as:

    ∀ ((x: T) => P(x))



In Logika, ∃ x P(x) is written as:

    ∃ ((x: T) => P(x))



--> what is "T"?


Slang->Insert Template->Forall. This will insert the statement:

∀((ID: TYPE) => CLAIM)



(similarly, insert a there exists statement)

////////////////////////////////

When you have homework or we do examples, the proof files
will look like this:

// #Sireum #Logika
//@Logika: --manual --background disabled

import org.sireum._
import org.sireum.justification._
import org.sireum.justification.natded.prop._
import org.sireum.justification.natded.pred._

@pure def ProofName[T](pred1: T => B @pure, pred2: T => B @pure,
                ..., indiv1: T, indiv2: T, ...): Unit = {
    Deduce(
        //@formatter:off
        (comma-separated list of premises)
            ⊢
        (conclusion)

        Proof(
            //the actual proof steps go here
        )
        //@formatter:on
    )
}

<-- stopped here, will continue on Thursday

///////////////////////////////

For-all elimination (∀e):

           ∀ ((x: T) => P(x))
AllE[T]:  ---------------------
                   P(v)

//where v is a particular individual in the domain
//(i.e, v has type T)


Idea:

- if we know that a statement is true for ALL individuals in
our domain


...then what would we know about a specific individual
in that domain?

///////////////////////////////

Syntax:

(
    ∀ ((x: T) => Human(x))
)
⊢
( Human(Socrates) )

Proof(
    1 ( ∀ ((x: T) => Human(x)) )    by Premise,
    2 Human(Socrates)               by ???
)

Note: This assumes "Socrates" and "Human" were both parameters
to our proof function:


@pure def Example[T](Human: T => B @pure, Socrates: T)



///////////////////////////////

Example (all1.sc)


∀ x (inCIS301(x) → takenCIS200(x)), inCIS301(bob) ⊢ takenCIS200(bob)


//////////////////////////////

Next rule will be for all introduction.

First: consider these two statements:


∀ x (P(x) ⋀ Q(x))           (∀ x P(x)) ⋀ (∀ x Q(x))


are they equivalent?

how would we defend our position?


//////////////////////////////////


For-all introduction (∀i):

            Let (   (a: T) => SubProof(
                ...
                P(a)
            )),
AllI[T] : -------------------------------
                 ∀ ((x: T) => P(x))


//"a" is an unused, "fresh" individual

Idea:

- We know a statement holds for some arbitrary individual
- That individual could have been anything!

...what can we say about that statement for all individuals?




Syntax:

4 Let ( (a: T) => SubProof(
    ...
    P(a)
)),
10 ( ∀ ((x: T) => P(x)) ) by AllI[T](4)


//a could be any (fresh) individual name


///////////////////////////////////

Example:

Prove these statements are equivalent:

∀ x (P(x) ⋀ Q(x))           (∀ x P(x)) ⋀ (∀ x Q(x))


all2.sc

///////////////////////////////////

Are these statements equivalent?

∀ x (P(x) ⋁ Q(x))           (∀ x P(x)) ⋁ (∀ x Q(x))



///////////////////////////////////

Next time:
- continue with for all quantifier example
- proofs and equivalences with the existential quantifier
