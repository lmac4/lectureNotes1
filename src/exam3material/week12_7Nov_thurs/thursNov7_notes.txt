HW 10 due Tuesday, November 12

Exam 3 is Thursday, November 14
    (will post review info soon)

///////////////////////

Today:
- review: function contracts
- finish absolute value example
- verifying recursive functions
- loop invariants
- verifying loops

////////////////////////

Function contract: lists preconditions and postconditions

Contract(
    Requires(list of preconditions),
    Ensures(list of postconditions)
)

preconditions: things we need to assume about our parameters
postcondition: describes what function returns / impact of calling function

1) Before calling function, we must:

prove the preconditions based on what we are passing as parameters


2) What can we do with preconditions inside the function?

use them as premises


3) Before returning from function, we must?

prove the postconditions


4) What can we do with postconditions after calling function?

list the postconditions from the function as premises


///////////////////////

Finish absolute value example

/////////////////////////////////

Recursive functions

- exactly the same idea

if (base case condition) {
    answer = base case
} else {

    //what to do here? prove precondition for the parameters
        //passed in that recursive call

    recursive call

    //what can we use here?
    //use the postcondition from the recursive call in
    //our reasoning

    answer = recursive call case
}

//what if we want to show some postcondition about answer?

//prove postcondition

return answer



/////////////////////////////////

Example (mult_rec.sc):

- multiplication through repeated (recursive) addition
- write function contract
- do verification

/////////////////////////////

Validating loops.

while (condition) {
    statements
}

<-- number of iterations? I don't know

We want to be able to make claims about our program after loop
is done


    ...why is this more challenging than an if-statement?

    needs to be true no matter how many iterations



//////////////////////////////

Solution: kind of like mathematical induction

Come up with a loop INVARIANT that summarizes the behavior
in a loop

- invariant should be true before loop begins
- should be STILL true at the end of each iteration


Steps to proving correctness of a loop:
----------------------------------------

1) Prove the invariant is true before the loop begins

    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)
    base case


2) Assume the invariant is true at the beginning of an iteration.
    Prove the invariant still holds at the end of the iteration.

    (what is this like in mathematical induction?)


    inductive step

/////////////////////////

When loop ends, you know two things:
    1) About the invariant?

        it's true (list as premise)



    2) About the loop condition?

        it's false



If your loop is in a function, you can use those two pieces
to prove the postcondition of the function.

(And if you can't, you need to make your invariant stronger.)

/////////////////////////

Loop invariant block: just inside the loop


//prove invariants here
while (condition) {
    Invariant(
        Modifies(list all variables modified in loop)
        invariant1,
        invariant2,
        ...
    )

    //use invariants as a premise

    code for the loop

    //prove the invariants still hold
}


/////////////////////////

Example: see code for multiplication with repeated addition
    using a loop (mult_loop.sc)

--> can we use the function contract from recursive implementation?




--> should the test cases/asserts be different?



--> what if the loop condition was "i < y" instead?


/////////////////////

Next time:
- more with loop invariants
- writing recursive definitions for postconditions/
    invariants
- review for exam 3
